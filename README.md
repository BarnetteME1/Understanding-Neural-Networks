# Neural Networks

I attempted to make a neural network for my final project at the Iron Yard, but
after taking a look into it, I decided that I didn't have the time or resources
to do a proper job. However, now that I have more time I'm going to look back
into them, starting by looking at https://iamtrask.github.io/ and exploring the
basics and then looking into different python libraries such as Lasagne, Keras,
Nolearn, and/or others.
